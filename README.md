-- By Trung HPB
Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repo !
Building a modern datawarehouse with SQL Server, including ETL processes, data modeling and analytics

This is my personal project, with its raw material (input data) gathered from public project (made by Data with Baraa): https://datawithbaraa.substack.com/p/build-a-data-warehouse-from-scratch
The original Github repo can be found at: https://github.com/DataWithBaraa/sql-data-warehouse-project


The projects emphasize on data modeling, cleaning and processing

Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
